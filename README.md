# agr-server-test
AGR Test (server side)
Project developed with NodeJs and Socket.io.
This project works together front side (https://github.com/jlcafferata/agr-test).

To test it:
  - Run npm install, to install dependencies.
  - Run npm start from terminal or command-line. It will start node server in port 3000 by default.
  - This project works with mocked data (investing.json) just to verify socket.io connection.
